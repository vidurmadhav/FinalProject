<h1 class="title main">READINGS</h1>

  <div class="firstdiv"><h1 class="title"><b>1. What is code? <span class="grey">by Paul Ford</span></h1>
<h2 class="subTitle">The article starts by answering the very basic questions of how a machine interprets an input command. The article eventually expands into the different kinds of such input commands which exist today in terms of developers languages. The article gives us an insight of not just the technical side of this science, but also how the mind of coders and developers function; what might they be thinking while making breakthrough technology in the past, and what kind of challenges interest them in the future. I felt an interesting part of the article was how it mixed this knowledge with that of known companies and studios at different times in different decades, which helped me visualise the development of this industry.</h2>

<div><h1 class="title"><b>2. What screens want <span class="grey">by Frank Chimero</span></h1>
<h2 class="subTitle">The article focuses on the development of the modern day ‘user interface’ design. It tracks the evolution of the different stages of screen design, and how the screen has seen the change of time. The article also strongly focuses on the argument that the screen is made for showing the content, and not the opposite. We must keep in mind that the changing screens should not be a major excuse to modify our content, which the author has proved has never been the driving factor in the digital evolution; but rather content has always been the king.</h2>

<div><h1 class="title"><b>3. Vernacular web 1 <span class="grey">by Olia Lialina</span></h1>
<h2 class="subTitle">Though we consider the internet to be a comparatively new phenomenon, this article by Olia Lialina emphasises on the changes which have happened across the past decade. It discusses the changes in ‘style’ and ‘expression’; and how its interpretation has changed for both he user and the developer. Though not completely relevant today, the writer talks about the changes in the quality of images, alignment on text and basic primitive aspects of today’s user experience design.</h2>
</div>

<div><h1 class="title"><b>4. Jodi's Infrastructure <span class="grey">by Alexander R. Galloway</span></h1>
<h2 class="subTitle">The writer throws light on the artistic side of the internet. While we generally perceive internet with engineering and design, little has been spoken about its artistic opportunities. While it was not readily accepted in the past, it now seems to be the future. The article made me think about what other such untapped opportunities might the internet hold, not just within art and design, but maybe even beyond? It can also be seen as a giant software which helps you fullfill the tasks of different professions using a uniform coding language.</h2>
</div>

<div><h1 class="title"><b>5. Capitalism vs. Privacy <span class="grey">by Samuel Earle</span></h1>
<h2 class="subTitle">While I am very intrigued by the concept of technology giants becoming business superpowers because of the simple fact of ‘knowing’ and ‘reading’ people well, it might eventually become a disaster. In a time of shrewd computing and hacking, people’s personal data is not only theirs, but instead can be manipulated and sold. While they transparency should be appreciated to a certain extent, its exclusivity and dependence has almost created new industries to prevent such leaks. I don’t see the capitalist gain reducing in the field of customisation through personal data, and am intrigued to think further on what kind of social and economic bars can be put to keep capitalism under control.</h2>
</div>

<div><h1 class="title"><b>6. Critical Atlas of Internet <span class="grey">by Louise Drulhe</span></h1>
<h2 class="subTitle">I felt the reading gave an incredible macro-level perspective of the internet. It helped create a visual map in the mind of the reader which helps navigate into specific areas within the expanse of the web. It also touches upon the mediums and methods that different technology giants have adopted over the past few years, which have resulted in their expansion and dominance in certain areas of the internet market. The article also makes the reader think about what might be the future of this internet marketshare, what would the graphical spread of the internet map look like ten years from today.</h2>
</div>

<div><h1 class="title"><b>7. New Clues <span class="grey">by David Weinberger</span></h1>
<h2 class="subTitle">The writer talks about his understanding of the internet in detail. On one hand, he talks about trying to personify the internet and make it more personal and warm like the people behind the screens instead of the cold bland network of wires, whereas on the other hand he talks about how the internet is not just a technical platform but a reflection of humans and their knowledge. Though contradicting his own opinions, I felt the article records all the permutations and combinations to understand the relevance of the internet, and critically analysing its future benefit.</h2>
